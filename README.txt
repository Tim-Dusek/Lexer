# Lexer
A lexical analyzer that takes pascal code and converts it into its lexical parts.

Compile and run using javac

This lexer takes an input file of pascal code (LexicalInput.txt) and returns an output file (LexicalOutput.txt).

I have uploaded multiple .txt input files. Just put the files in the programs local directory and change the name to LexialInput.txt in order to use them with the program as the file name is hardcoded.

If you don't wish to run this program yourself I have run the program with the first LexicalInput.txt file and placed the programs output in this Github directory as OutputExample.txt.
